# Motivation for the Book
Quantum computing is the future of computing, therefore it's essential that younger students learn about quantum computing. But, there's a large gap in existing introductory quantum computing books for the younger generation. As a high school student trying to learn about quantum computing, most of the "introductory" quantum computing books weren't introductory at all and were too complex! Many of these books contained complicated math, irrelevant to developing a conceptual understanding of quantum computing. Also, many of these books had a bland design, not appealing to younger students (like me). Therefore, I decided to create an introductory book on quantum computing with minimal math and colorful designs! This book still conveys the conceptual understanding behind quantum computing while only using minimal math, appealing to everyone and especially younger students! Also, this book has colorful designs, helping appeal to younger readers!
